1 license-detection error:
 1. License validation failed: Dependency 'example.com/gpl' uses license 'GNU General Public License v1.0 or later' which is not allowed on applications that run on customer machines.

    This probably means that you added or upgraded a dependency, and the
    automated opensource-license-checker can't confidently detect what
    the license is.  (This is a good thing, because it is reminding you
    to check the license of libraries before using them.)

    Some possible causes for this issue are:

    - Dependency is proprietary Ambassador Labs software: Update
    function IsAmbassadorProprietarySoftware() to correctly identify the
    dependency

    - License information can't be identified: Add an entry to
    hardcodedGoDependencies, hardcodedPythonDependencies or
    hardcodedJsDependencies depending on the dependency that was not
    identified.
