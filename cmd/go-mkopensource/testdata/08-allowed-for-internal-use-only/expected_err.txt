1 intended-usage error:
 1. License validation failed for Go: Dependency 'example.com/gpl' uses license 'GNU General Public License v1.0 or later' which is not allowed on applications that run on customer machines.

    This means that a dependency uses a license that is not allowed for
    use on customer servers. Refer to
    https://www.notion.so/datawire/License-Management-5194ca50c9684ff4b301143806c92157#1cd50aeeafa7456bba24c761c0a2d173
    for more details.

    To solve this error, replace the dependency with another that uses
    an acceptable license.
