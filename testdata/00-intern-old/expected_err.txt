package "github.com/josharian/intern": could not identify a license for all sources (had no global LICENSE file)
    This probably means that you added or upgraded a dependency, and the
    automated opensource-license-checker can't confidently detect what
    the license is.  (This is a good thing, because it is reminding you
    to check the license of libraries before using them.)

    You need to update the "github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource/pkg/detectlicense/licenses.go"
    file to correctly detect the license.
